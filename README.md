# plt-att-speech

**plt-att-speech-objc/plt-att-speech-swift** show basic Bluetooth audio capture with the headset.

**SimpleSpeech** is a modification of ATT's sample SpeechKit app that listens to speech from the headset and sends it to the ATT speech server to be transcribed to text. *This code worked yesterday, not so much today. Your milage may vary. If it works for you let us know! :)*

It may be a good idea to register for your own speech API app keys at [ATT's developer site](http://developer.att.com) to avoid collisions with other hackers.
